# Invoice-OCR
OCR using Roboflow and YOLOv8

The project aims to develop a system capable of automatically detecting and extracting invoice bill information from Bills. This system could be beneficial for various applications such as automated billing processes, data entry automation, and identity verification systems. By leveraging deep learning techniques, specifically the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm, the system can locate and extract invoice bill details from images of Bills.

Object Detection: Implementing the YOLO algorithm to detect regions of interest (ROIs) containing invoice bill sections within Bill images.
Information Extraction: Extracting relevant details such as invoice numbers, dates, amounts, and vendor names from the detected ROIs.
Automation: Automating the process of invoice bill information extraction to improve efficiency and reduce manual effort.

The development of an automated system for detecting invoice bill information in Bills has significant potential in various domains. By leveraging deep learning techniques, particularly YOLO object detection, the system can accurately locate and extract invoice details, thereby streamlining processes and reducing manual effort. Continuous refinement and optimization of the model will further enhance its performance and applicability in real-world scenarios.
